# Titan Missile Sites

I recently toured the Titan Missile Museum (~1 hour south of Tucson) in Sahaurita, AZ and was intrigued by the fact that there was an entire network of decomissioned ICBM launch sites surrounding Tucson.
At first I went about this by manually locating the sites from a sketch of their rough locations that I saw at the museum.
After additional research I found a webpage that had the locations of these sites documented and decided to use this as a way to practice my web-scraping skills.

This notebook (click below) scrapes the locations of declassified, decomissioned missile sites thoughout the U.S. and plots thier locations using the Geoviews python library.
